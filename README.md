# UNEAT
An implementation from scratch of a general-purpose algorithm performing *NeuroEvolution through Augmenting Topologies* (NEAT) in python. The goal is to produce a single python module capable of both creating and training a Neural Network solving the widest possible range of problems (from prediction to a simple game AI). For now, it is more of proof of concept and a way to become comfortable with Neural Networks and Genetic Algorithms.

Old, buguy (though more functional for now) here: https://github.com/EFugier/NEAT

#### Credits
The NEAT algorithm that inspired this project was introduced by Kenneth O. Stanley and Risto Miikkulainen in 2002 in [this](http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf) paper.
