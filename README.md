# UNEAT

**First CS project, old (~2015) and ugly code !**

An implementation from scratch of a general-purpose algorithm performing *NeuroEvolution through Augmenting Topologies* (NEAT) in python. It's capable of both generating a neural network whose architecture's evolves during the training process.

#### Credits
The NEAT algorithm that inspired this project was introduced by Kenneth O. Stanley and Risto Miikkulainen in 2002 in [this paper](http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf).
